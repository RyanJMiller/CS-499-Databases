# CS-499-Databases

This enhanced artifact is an inventory management application for android mobile devices running API 31+. I originally developed this application as part of my work in the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The application was made using Android Studio. It allows users to register for and sign into accounts and keep track of various inventory entries.
